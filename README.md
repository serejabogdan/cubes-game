Game rules:
The essence of the game is as follows: there is a field on which the "cubes" are placed in random order - colored blocks.

Remove the most dice from the field. To remove a cube, you need to click on it. The given time is 1 minute. Removal of each cube brings 1 point to the player.
After time expires a pop-up window appears on which the number of the gained points and the field for player name input are displayed.

After entering the name and pressing the button "OK" ("Save"), a line with the entered player's name and the corresponding number of points is added to the results table.
